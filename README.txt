# Pig Dice Game

  This is a simple web-based Pig Dice Game.


  In the Pig Dice game, two or more players take turns rolling a standard six-sided die and accumulating points. 
  The goal is to be the first player to reach target score of 100 points.
  
  On a player's turn, they can roll the die as many times as they want, and the result of each roll is added to their "current score."
  If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and their turn ends. They lose all the points accumulated during that turn.
  A player can choose to "hold" their current score at any time during their turn. 
  When they hold, their current score is added to their "total score," and their turn ends.
  The first player to reach the target score of 100 points, wins the game.
